# Functional Programming Lab 4 proposal - Perfect mazes

For our project we want to create a program that generates perfect mazes.
Our definition of a perfect maze is a maze without loops, or a spanning tree.

The minimal requirement of a successful project is:
 * Graphical interface for selecting options and presenting the mazes
 * Program produces mazes of any size set by the user
 * Mazes are generated by at least one of the proposed algorithms
 * Properties that verify that the generated mazes are perfect,
   that all tiles are reachable and so on.

Additional tasks that we may complete:
 * Allow the user to navigate and 'solve' the labyrinth using the keyboard
 * User may choose which algorithm the maze is generated with
 * Finding suitable start- and end positions
 * Export and import mazes to/from suitable formats
   (JSON? ASCII? Custom format?)

Definitions and explanations of different algorithms are given in
[this presentation](http://www.jamisbuck.org/presentations/rubyconf2011).
It is also an entertaining read.

We're sorry that we missed the deadline,
we didn't realize it was so soon after the last lab.
